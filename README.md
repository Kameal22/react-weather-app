# Weather app with weather api and geolocation use.

## Very simple project in which I tried to write cleaner code.

### Choosing city to show weather in, and responsive background image to that weather. Saving cities. Application is also responsive for mobile users. It's a quick laid back project before doing the next, much bigger one.
